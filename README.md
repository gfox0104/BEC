- For those trading coins in accumulation and bullish phases, calculates EMA cross combination (with [backtesting python library](https://kernc.github.io/backtesting.py)) with highest returns for 1D, 4H and 1H timeframes. 4-years of historicals prices are used in backtesting. 
- Each coin will be traded with its best EMA cross on each timeframe. 
- If best EMA result is negative the coin will be ignored and will not be traded. 
- To calculate Best EMA uses the stable pair (BUSD or USDT) with more historical data.
- Uses csv files to store which coins are in position.
- Uses csv files to store executed buy and sell orders.
- Calculates PnL for executed sell orders.
